      "body": "While there are several similarities between Reactjs and React Native, however, there are some notable differences as well. Let‚Äôs have a look:\n\nReactjs can be described as a base derivative of React DOM, for the web platform while React Native is a base derivative in itself, which means that the syntax and workflow remain the same, but components alter.\nReactjs, eventually, is a JavaScript library, which enables the programmer to create an engaging and high performing UI Layer while React Native is an entire framework for building cross-platform apps, be it web, iOS or Android. \nIn Reactjs, virtual DOM is used to render browser code in Reactjs while in React Native, native APIs are used to render components in mobile.\nThe apps developed with Reactjs renders HTML in UI while React Native uses JSX for rendering UI, which is nothing but javascript. \nCSS is used for creating styling in Reactjs while a stylesheet is used for styling in React Native.\nIn Reactjs, the animation is possible, using CSS, just like web development while in React Native, an animated API is used for inducing animation across different components of the React Native application.\nIf the need is to build a high performing, dynamic, and responsive UI for web interfaces, then Reactjs is the best option while if the need is to give mobile apps a truly native feeling, then React Native is the best option.",
